-a view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. 

<p> -> <Text>
<img> -> <Image>
//Displays different types of images
<input type="text"> -> <TextInput>
//Allows the user to enter text

state is like a componentâ€™s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
